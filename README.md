## Depreacted! This is the old alveron package which has been deprecated in favor of a newer version without Redux. Check out the new [alveron](https://github.com/rofrischmann/alveron) package which was once called react-woodworm.

# alveron

Alveron is a highly opinionated state architecture for React using Redux.<br>
It is heavily inspired by The Elm Architecture and aims to simplify component-based state management.

## Installation
> Alveron requires `react-redux` to be installed in your project. Therefore, `react` must also be installed.

```sh
yarn add alveron react react-redux
```

## Benefits
* locally-scoped state
* plays well with third-party reducer
* single file for markup & application state
* simple & compact interface


## The Gist
```javascript
import { createContainer } from 'alveron'

// the initial state
const model = 0

// the reducer functions
const update = {
  increase: state => state + 1,
  decrease: state => state - 1
}

// a functional component which gets both the state
// and the action dispatcher passed via props
const view = ({ state, increase, decrease }) => (
  <div>
    <span>Counter: {state}</span>
    <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
    <button onClick={decrease}>Decrease</button>
  </div>
)

// the single higher-order function that links
// everything together and returns a React component
const Counter = createContainer({
  view,
  update,
  model
})()

// usage
<Counter />
```
